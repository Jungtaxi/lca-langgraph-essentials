      "**LangGraph** is an open-source framework built by LangChain that is specifically designed for creating and managing complex AI agent workflows. Here are the key points about it:\n",
      "\n",
      "## What It Does:\n",
      "- **Agent Orchestration**: LangGraph provides a structured framework for defining, coordinating, and executing multiple LLM (Large Language Model) agents or chains in a coordinated manner\n",
      "- **Graph-Based Architecture**: It uses graph structures (specifically state machines) to model how AI agents interact and process information\n",
      "- **Stateful Applications**: It manages the flow of data and the sequence of operations, handling state management for complex AI applications\n",
      "\n",
      "## Key Features:\n",
      "- **Cyclic Graphs**: Unlike traditional linear workflows, LangGraph supports cyclic graphs, allowing agents to loop back and iterate on tasks\n",
      "- **Multi-Agent Systems**: It enables building systems where multiple AI agents can work together to handle complex tasks\n",
      "- **Low-Level Control**: It provides more granular control compared to higher-level frameworks like LangChain agents\n",
      "\n",
      "## Use Cases:\n",
      "- Building sophisticated chatbots that can handle various types of user requests\n",
      "- Creating multi-agent systems that perform complex, multi-step tasks\n",
      "- Developing AI agents with memory and context awareness\n",
      "- Building agentic applications that require decision-making and branching logic\n",
      "\n",
      "In essence, LangGraph is a specialized tool within the LangChain ecosystem that makes it easier to build intelligent, stateful AI agent systems by treating them as graph-based workflows rather than simple linear chains.\n"
